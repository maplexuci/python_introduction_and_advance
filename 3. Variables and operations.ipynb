When making the assignment `b = a`, `b` will have the reference to the same list object. Then, `a[0] = 6` changes one element of `a`, makes the value of `a` becomes `[6, 2, 3, 4]`, but this list is still the same object, it's just one element of it is changed, but no new assignment is made, so no new reference is created, now `a` is still referenced to the same list object, one of whose element is changed.

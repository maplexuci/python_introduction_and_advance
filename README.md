# python_introduction_and_advance

This is the notes of each lesson of an online course in Mooc, called Introductory and Advanced Python.

All notes were taken in Jupyter Notebook.

When taking the note, I tried to be as specific as possible, including as many example as possible covered in the course as well as the explanation of a lot of the coding running.

However, the notes were taken very fast while listening to the course, and they haven't gone through proof-reading yet. Therefore, there will be a lot mistakes in the word spelling and the orgnazation and code commenting is not that great yet. Will gradualy imporve them.

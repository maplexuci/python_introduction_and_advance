    "This is a very strange way to call the superclass constructor.  \n",

    "First of all, `Human` is a class, `__init__` is an instance method.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "It should be an object to call an instance method. It is strange and doesn't make a lot sense logically for a class to call an instance method, although python allows you to do that.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "When we creating instances, e.g. `student1 = Student('First School', 'Jane', 20)`, it looks like we also used class `Student` to call the constructor. But actually it is not. It is the mechenism of python for creating instance that automaticlly call the constructor for us. Under this mechenism, python will auto-fill the `self` variable (to pass `self` into the constructor) for us.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "But for `Human.__init__(name, age)` is substantially different with instance creation. This is a class (`Human`) calling a method (`__init__`), so just a ordinary method calling, therefore, of course, we need to pass all the parameters for that method.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "You may also noticed that when we call instance method through object, we don't need to pass `self` to the call. e.g. `student1.do_homework()`. That is because we call the instance through an object, and python knows that the variable `self` in the method refers to the object that is calling the method. e.g. Here, python knows `self` variable refers to `student1`, so it automaticlly pass `student1` to the `self` variable in `do_homework(self)` method.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "So if you want to try to call instance method through a class. e.g. we do this `Student.do_homework()`, python will give us error saying `do_homework() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'`. Because we are calling instance method through class, python doesn't know which instance in the class you are refering to call this method. Therefore, you need to pass a argument to the method calling stating the instance for variable `self`, like this `Student.do_homework(student1)`. Now although it runs, but `Student.do_homework(student1)` is a very funny way of writing code. Because, we have already created the instance `student1`, we are able to call `do_homework()` directly using `student1`, there is absolutly no necessary to use the class `Student` to call `do_homework()` and again passing an already created instance `student1` to the call. It is just stupid, although python didn't forbit us to to that. By calling instance method using class, `self` becomes an very ordinary parameter like `name` and `age`. Actually, you can pass any argument in this type of call, because `self` is no longer refers to an instance.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Therefore, it is not recommanded to use this type of call. Another reason for avoiding doing this is if we decide to modify the superclass name later, we need to make the corresponding changes whereever this name is used in the method."
